        "## Creation\nDeep domain aware datasets are a unified representation of data for deep\nmethods in skada.\n\nIn those datasets, a data sample has four (optionally, five) attributes:\n  * the data point :code:`X`\n  * the label :code:`y`\n  * the domain :code:`sample_domain`\n  * optionally, the weight :code:`sample_weight`\n  * the sample index :code:`sample_idx` (automatically generated), which is\n      the index of the sample in the dataset, relative to its domain.\n\nNote that the data is not shuffled, so the order of the samples is preserved.\n\n.. WARNING::\n  In a dataset, either all data samples have a weight, or none of them.\n  On the other hand, it is possible that a sample has no associated label or domain.\n  In that case, it will be associated to label :code:`-1` and domain :code:`0`.\n\nDeepDADatasets can be created from numpy arrays, torch tensors, lists,\ntuples, or dictionary of one of the former.\n\nIf a dictionary is provided, it must contain the keys :code:`X`, :code:`y`(optional),\n:code:`sample_domain`(optional) and :code:`sample_weight`(optional).\n\nIf both dictionary and positional arguments are provided, the dictionary\narguments will take precedence over the positional ones.\n\n"
